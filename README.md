# About Me :waving_hand:
Hello everyone! My name is Victoria Vu and I'm a fourth year at UCLA studying cognitive science and minor in data science engineering. I have taken a multitude of high level computer science courses related to data science and machine learning, as well as high level psychology classes. I believe this has given me the tools needed to not only create programs that can interact with data, but also interpret and make it applicable in a business setting. Please reach out with opportunites at victoriiavu@ucla.edu!
